# Web-cam-detector-python-opencv
This is a basic code to build a webcam detector and read the info about when a face is detected into a csv file.
It also detects when the face exits the webcam and stores the same in the csv file. 

when the code is run, there a three windows that show up, one shows the actual image being detected in the webcam(the color frame), the other shows the guassian blur which i used to get obtain the difference that we are able see in the threshold window. 

On pressing 'q', the windows close and the details of when an image is detected and when the image moves out of the webcam is updated in a csv file.
